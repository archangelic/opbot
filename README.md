opbot is a cheap alternative to chanserv
opbot should:
* when it first joins a channel, it should detect all current ops and add them to the op list
* automatically give op to anyone on the op list for that channel
* have a command to add new users to the op list
* automatically op new user
* have a command to remove user from op list and should deop said user
